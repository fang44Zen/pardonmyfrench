## How to use it

For now there is not alot of tools, but here is a quick view. Once you created your account and you're connected, you can go to the "Create Exercises" page and select the one that you want.

### Create Questions:

Instead of adding a thousand of questions and having a giant list with no order. Then you can create group of question and sort then into a theme.Let's say you are studying french and you just finished the course about clothes and accessories.
